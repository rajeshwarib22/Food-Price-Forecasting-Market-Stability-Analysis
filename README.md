# Food-Price-Forecasting-Market-Stability-Analysis

The purpose of the study targets the times of natural disasters, the COVID pandemic, and issues faced by people related to availability of the food items. Here we are planning to compare the food price indices, consumer and producer indices before and during the pandemic also the customer buying patterns and panic buying. We will be comparing multiple cloud-based services for data storing, analysis, and machine learning.

## Introduction: 
Extreme weather conditions delay the food supply chain. It can change food prices. Because of this, customers, producers, and suppliers find it difficult to maintain market stability. This project will help with well-informed and long-term decisions.
Due to limited availability of labor, interruptions in the supply chain, rising customer demand, and customer panic buying. Utilizing machine learning for demand forecasting and price prediction would be helpful. This will help improve budgeting and will help people find the best offers and notify them about the availability of the food items. Inventory control and demand forecasting will help to avoid supply shortages and stockpiling due to panic buying.
We already know local hurricanes in the US create panic and it will cause changes in the food cost and availability of the food items.
Data-driven systems will help improve market transparency, stabilize the prices, and guarantee more table distribution of supplies during these moments. This study will create a robust and effective grocery supply chain by utilizing cloud-based solutions and advanced analytics.

## Gain and Contributions from the Project:
1. Improved Market Insight: The research offers useful data on market dynamics through the examination of food price indices, consumer price indices, and producer purchases before and during the pandemic. This can result in improved market understanding and the ability to foresee changes in the market, leading to improved decision-making.
2. More market stability: This research will create an evidence-driven system for improving market information and tracking food prices. This can assist distributors in managing commodity delivery during periods of peaks, e.g., pandemics or natural disasters, mellowing the impact of extreme price fluctuations and scarcity.
3. Support to Government Authority: The tools and dashboards constructed by this project can potentially be used to aid government authorities in maintaining market stability, minimizing shortages, and implementing equitable distribution of necessary goods. This is mainly relevant to planning in the long term and management of crises.
